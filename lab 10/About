#Lab 10: Exchange rate of EUR against USD

Data are from IMF(International Monetary Fund). There are 3 different kinds of plots in this file, but they're all describing the change of the forex.
Usually exchange rate are highly correlated with interest rates among countries' central bank. 

However, I didn't use the interest rate to make comparison, which is definitly the part I should improve.
