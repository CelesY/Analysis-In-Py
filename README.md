As can be seen, it is kind of a student report based on R.
The resource of the data is CEINET database, it is an open resource for everyone who visit the website. 
I got these data through school's library, so the data is completly free.
And it has to be pointed out that the code I uploaded is one of, but the very core part of the whole report.
I'm still learning on R, and It's extremely welcome to point out all  deficiencies in the code.(But PLZ BE POLITE)
